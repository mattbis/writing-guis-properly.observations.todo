.. it seems since nobody understands this I will have to note some things down

### pre notes

1) UI Thread & Main Process

2) Windowing and GUI Limitations

3) Understanding GDI and PostMessage

4) Understanding OpenGL is not going to solve your problems

5) Cross-platform When and When Not ( OSX First compilation is fraught with problems on other platforms )

#### constraints - os internals - security and saturation

Factors that effect **scale**, **complexity** 

1) dynamic link libraries
2) so
3) osx

### CONCEPTS

1) - Point1 is simple **MOST PEOPLE ARE POOR** they do not have the latest and greatest - in fact they are likely 2-6 years behind hardware wise... 

#### RUNTIME MODES

1) What are modes? How many should we have ? See ( user research )
2) Before releasing your product and assets ( make sure you really understand your market, your consumers, the tech stack and you hire REALLY GOOD TESTERS )
